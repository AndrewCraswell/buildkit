# Better Apps example

A [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) app that runs
[Better Apps](../../packages/better-apps/better-apps/README.md) features on SQLite, wired with
[`@better-apps/tanstack-start`](../../packages/better-apps/tanstack-start/README.md). It has no sign-in:
`localIdentity()` makes every request act as one local user.

Build the packages it uses once, then start it:

```sh
pnpm turbo run build --filter=@better-apps/example^...
pnpm --filter @better-apps/example dev
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4190>. `build` and `preview` run the production build at <http://127.0.0.1:4191>.

## What's in it

- **Notes**, on the home page, is a tiny feature in `src/features.ts`. Its loader calls a server function that calls
  `api.notes.list()` as the request's user, and the form posts to `/api/apps/notes/add` from the browser.
- **Invoices** is the app's own table, in `src/db/schema.ts`, with a list page and a detail page. The app adds five
  sample invoices on start. Comments will attach to invoices as their subject.
- `src/better-apps.server.ts` creates the app and its Start bindings. `src/routes/api/apps/$.ts` serves the actions.
- `src/start.ts` only lets same-origin requests call server functions.

## Database

The app stores its data in `.data/example.db`, which it creates on start. Set `DATABASE_FILE` to use another file, or
`:memory:` for a database that lasts until the server stops. Delete the file to start over.

Tables come from migrations in `drizzle/`, which the app applies on start with Drizzle's migrator. The migrations cover
the app's tables and the features' tables, which `better-apps generate` writes to `src/db/better-apps-schema.ts`. After
adding a feature or changing a table, run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @better-apps/example db:generate
```

It regenerates the features' schema from `better-apps.config.ts`, then writes a new migration with `drizzle-kit`. Commit
both.

## Times and dates

Pages are rendered on the server and again in the browser, so dates and times use a fixed locale and time zone. Times
are shown in UTC.
